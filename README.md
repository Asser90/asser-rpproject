# Asser's RP Project
This is a RP project based off of essentialmode and es_mysql.

At this stage the project is quite new. So no info atm.

I just hate ESX and VRP - I want to create a simple rp server resource.

## Install
1. Install essentialmode
  1. Optionally install es_admin2 
1. Install esplugin_mysql
1. Install mysql-async
1. Add the startup code to your server.

## Startup Code
```
#Essentials
start mysql-async
start essentialmode
start esplugin_mysql
start es_admin2

#Asser Essentials Main
start asser_main
```
